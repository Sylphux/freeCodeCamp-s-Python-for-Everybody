## Index

Other/00_basics.py
- I will try everything i learned in the first courses including basic math, user inputs, comparisons, try and excepts, ifs elses and elifs
- It is possible that this program becomes very very long while i learn...

C3_Conditionals/01_pay_compute.py
- Calculates pay with provided hours, rate and *1,5 for hours over 40

C3_Conditionals/02_scores.py
- Gives a score based on the float provided.

C4_Functions/01_scores_func.py
- Same as above but the result is calculated in a dedicated function

C5_Iterations/01_input_list.py
- Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters "done". Once "done" is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.
- Exercise 2: Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.
